# No-Gravity-unity-3d-controller
This movement only works sideways for unity  so for creating 2d games with 3d physics and rotations.


Important notes:
- This implements a different type of relational gravity so you may need to tick gravity off
- Pivot of the moving character should be at the bottom of the character
